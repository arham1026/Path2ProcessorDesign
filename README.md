# Path2ProcessorDesign
This project aims to design a custom 4 stage pipelined RISCV based processor which will perform and execute basic commands like arithmetic operations,logic operations and memory storage.The project has been initiated by a person to merely understand the chip design flow and to potentially enter into the world of IC design
Towards the end of project hopefully a fully programmed Processor will be made professionally on a PCB.
All the simulations,graphs,results,circuit designs will be available on this repo in the coming months.
